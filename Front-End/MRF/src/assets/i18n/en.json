      "QUESTION": "<strong>How much range do they have?</strong>",
      "ANSWER": "Between 60 and 70 kilometers of total range with an average-weight person. This is more than enough to explore towns like Las Palmas or Maspalomas and travel to nearby municipalities such as Mogán or Santa Lucía in the south of the island, or Telde, Santa Brígida, San Mateo, Teror, Tejeda, or Arucas if departing from the island's capital."
    },
    "RECHARGE": {
      "QUESTION": "<strong>How can I recharge the batteries?</strong>",
      "ANSWER": "Our scooters come with 2 batteries of 30-35 km each. They are removable, and you can charge them at any standard outlet. 80% of the battery charges in 3 hours, and the remaining 20% takes an additional 2-3 hours, depending on the level of discharge. Our chargers show a red indicator when charging and a green one when fully charged. You can leave the charger plugged in when the indicator is green.",
      "RECOMMENDATIONS": "If you return to your hotel/apartment with both batteries drained and want to ensure they are fully charged by the next day, charge the less-drained battery before sleeping, then switch to the more-drained one. In the morning, if the first battery isn't finished, you can switch back, and it will fully charge while you have breakfast and get ready."
    },
    "EXPERIENCE": {
      "QUESTION": "<strong>Do I need experience using scooters or motorcycles?</strong>",
      "ANSWER": "Our scooters are very easy to drive, and no prior experience with any type of motorized two-wheeled vehicle is required."
